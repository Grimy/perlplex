This repository contains various short programs I wrote for fun.
.in files are example inputs for programs with the same base name.

spira.pl:
	An interpreter for an esoteric stack-based functional language I designed.

simplexe.{pl,py}:
	Implements the simplex algorithm. Infinite precision.

pi.sh:
	Computes an approximation of pi in barely 32 characters. The approximation gets more accurate if the current directory contains huge files.

strace.sh:
	strace recursively tracing itself.

bf.pl:
	A Brainfuck interpreter in 105 characters. Expected input: <bf program>!<input for the bf program>

seg.pl:
	Implements various functions using regexes as the only flow control.

apocalypse.pl:
	Probably my best JAPH. Prints "Just another Perl hacker".
